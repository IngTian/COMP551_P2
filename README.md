# COMP551 Project 2 (Fall 2021)

## Acknowledgements

This repository is for **COMP551** at **McGill University** for **fall 2021**. Thanks to Zeying Tian, Kevin Li, and Ao Shen, without whom this project cannot be accomplished.

## Description
In this project, we examine the effects of various modifications to the **Gradient Descent** optimizer; more specifically, we wish to experiment with **mini-batches** and **momentum**. The model we use is **Logistic Regression**. Then, we apply our knowledge in text classification, i.e., to classify fake news.
